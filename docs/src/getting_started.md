# Getting Started

This section will guide you through the steps required to install the library and provide a simple example to help you get started.
## [Installation](@id install-guide)

To use the Bond Graph Toolkit, you need to have Julia installed on your system. If you haven't installed Julia yet, follow the official [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/) for instructions specific to your operating system or go directly to the [Julia Download](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.

Once Julia is installed, you can proceed with installing the Bond Graph toolkit by following these steps:

1. Launch Julia by opening the Julia REPL or the Julia command-line interface.
2. Enter the package manager by pressing the `]` key. You should see the prompt change to `pkg>`.
3. Inside the package manager, type the following command to add the library:
   ```julia
   pkg> add BondGraphToolkit.jl
   ```
4. Wait for Julia to download and install the library and its dependencies. This process may take a few moments depending on your internet connection and system performance.
5. Once the installation is complete, you can exit the package manager by pressing the `backspace` key or by typing `Ctrl+C`.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the library and are ready to start using it.
