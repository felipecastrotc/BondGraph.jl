# Modeling 

This section introduces the general concepts and techniques for modeling bond graph systems using the Bond Graph Toolkit. It describes the general aspect of the library and how it is organized the basic elements, such as inertance, compliance, resistance, and junctions, and explains how to connect these elements to build complex system models.
