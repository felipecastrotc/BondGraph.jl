**Introduction**: Start with an introduction section that provides an overview of the library and its purpose. Explain what the library does, its main features, and its intended use cases. This section should provide a high-level understanding of the library's capabilities.

A package for building documentation from docstrings and markdown files.

    of the main Julia manual if this is your first time using Julia's documentation system.
    Once you've read through how to write documentation for your code then come back here.
