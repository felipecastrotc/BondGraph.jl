# TODO

## Issues

### Expression signs

Where: Junction functions

* CHECK WHY DISABILITATING THE SIGN IN THE EQUALITY THE DC MOTOR MODEL MATCHES WITH THE LITERATURE
* CHECK IF THE SIGN CONVENTION IS ONLY FOR THE SUM

Example: https://www.20sim.com/webhelp/modeling_tutorial_bond_graphs_frombondgraphtoequations.php

The example considers the convention only for the sum in the equality it does not consider the arrow direction.

### MSD systems

Where: NDOF - MSD system examples

Issues:
1. Verify the equations generated by the new Junction1 and Junction0
2. The functions were significantly changed errors are expected


## Features

### MTF

Level: **Hard-medium**

Description:
1. Add the modulated transformer to the library
2. Debug the current version, it is not giving consistent results

Reason:
1. A basic feature for the library

Ideas:
1. Rewrite the current version to be like the `mGY`.
2. Try to find the 20-sim mGY like example to verify the equations

Notes:
1. There is an old code on `dev_test_bg.jl` it probably is not useful, remember to clean

### Rename by Dict()

Level: **medium-easy**

Description:

1. Rename variables given a dictionary

Reason:

1. Make the equations generated easier to read or more readable

Ideas:

1. Extend the functionalities of the function `substitute_dict`.

Notes:

1. There is an old code on `dev_test_bg.jl` it probably is not useful, remember to clean
